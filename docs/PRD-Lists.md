1. Overview
In our multi‐page web application with a floating top‐centered navbar, each page should include clear, primary CTA buttons to guide users in performing critical actions (e.g., uploading a file, creating a new batch). Additionally, we need a dedicated Batch Detail Page that allows users to view and manage batch status, logs, error messages, and final output.

2. CTA Placement and Functionality
2.1 Files Page
CTA: “Upload File”
Placement: Typically top‐right (or top‐left) of the main content area.
Action: Opens the File Upload flow (a modal or a new page/section) where the user selects a CSV/Excel file, sees a preview, and saves it to local storage.
Rationale: Encourages new users or returning users to immediately add data to process.
2.2 Batches Page
CTA: “Create Batch”
Placement: Similarly top‐right of the main content area.
Action: Opens or navigates to a Batch Configuration flow (choose file, set prompts/parameters).
Rationale: Keeps the main action clear for users who want to start a new batch from existing files.
2.3 Batch Detail Page
Access: Clicking on a batch entry in the Batches Page opens its detail view.
Layout (inspired by the attached OpenAI screenshot):
Header/Status Area:
Batch ID or Name (e.g., batch_677514b94e...).
Status (Completed, In Progress, Failed, Cancelled).
Metadata (creation date/time, endpoint/model used, run duration, etc.).
Download Output (if completed).
Center or Right Pane:
Timeline or Logs listing key events (created, started, partial progress, finalizing, completed).
Request/Row Counts: Completed vs. total requests.
Side Column or Additional Section:
Input File reference and link to open or preview.
Output File link (download).
Error messages (if any).
Actions:
If the batch is In Progress: a “Cancel Batch” button.
If the batch is Failed or Completed: a “Re‐run Batch” or “Create New Batch” button (optional).
3. Page‐by‐Page CTAs and Flow
Files Page

Top bar: “Upload File”.
User clicks → navigates to Upload UI or shows an upload modal → Once uploaded, the file is added to the Files list.
Batches Page

Top bar: “Create Batch”.
User clicks → goes to a new page or modal to select an existing file, configure prompts, and define AI parameters → Submits to create the batch.
All existing batches are listed below, each with a clickable row to see Batch Detail.
Batch Detail Page

Display’s batch status, creation date, total requests, logs.
The user can see key events (e.g., time started, time ended, partial errors).
If completed: “Download Output” button.
If failed or canceled: “Re‐run” or “Create a New Batch” button to fix prompts or parameters.
If in progress: “Cancel” button.

5. Key Considerations
CTA Visibility: By placing CTAs in the same location (top‐right or top bar) on each page, users quickly learn where to initiate main actions.
Consistency: Use consistent button styles (e.g., color, rounded corners) to emphasize primary actions.
Modal vs. Dedicated Page: Decide if you want a quick modal or a full page to handle “Upload File” and “Create Batch.”
State‐Based Actions: In the Batch Detail page, the CTA changes based on the batch status (e.g., “Cancel” if running, “Download” if completed).
Error Handling: If an error happens (e.g., invalid file or prompt), direct users to fix it with a clear CTA (e.g., “Edit Batch”).
6. Summary
Files Page now has a “Upload File” CTA (top‐right).
Batches Page has a “Create Batch” CTA (top‐right).
Batch Detail Page (like your OpenAI screenshot) includes status‐specific CTAs:
“Cancel” (while running),
“Download Output” (when completed),
“Re‐run Batch” or “Create New Batch” (if failed or if user wants to replicate settings).
